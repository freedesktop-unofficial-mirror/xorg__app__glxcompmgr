glxcompmgr - OpenGL compositing manager

For now you need Mesa compiled with mesa-glx-x11-render-texture-3.diff
patch in this directory to run it. We'll need to figure out a better way 
of creating textures from pixmaps: EXT_texture_from_drawable for example.


glxcompmgr is an OpenGL compositing manager that use GLX_MESA_render_texture
for binding redirected top-level windows to texture objects. It has a flexible
plug-in system and it is designed to run well on most graphics hardware.
